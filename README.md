# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository contains research and documentation focused on the **requirement analysis phase** of software development. It explores how large-scale systems, like hotel booking applications (e.g., Airbnb, Booking.com, and OYO), are architected to deliver smooth user experiences. The purpose is to understand how various services‚Äîlike hotel listing, searching, booking, and payments‚Äîare handled efficiently using modern software practices such as microservices, messaging queues, caching, and distributed databases.

This repository is part of the ALX software engineering program and aims to provide clear, simplified explanations of complex system designs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers, stakeholders, and business analysts work together to **identify, gather, analyze, and document** the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.

This phase ensures that everyone involved has a **clear and shared understanding** of what the software should do, who will use it, how it will be used, and the conditions it must meet to be considered successful.

### üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:

- **Requirements Gathering**: Collecting needs from stakeholders (users, clients, business teams).
- **Requirements Elicitation**: Interviewing, observing, or sending questionnaires to stakeholders to discover true needs.
- **Requirements Specification**: Documenting the requirements in a clear and structured format (e.g., SRS ‚Äì Software Requirements Specification).
- **Requirements Validation**: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect what the client wants and are feasible.
- **Requirements Management**: Handling changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

### üìå Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Avoids Miscommunication**: Helps ensure all stakeholders are aligned before development begins.
2. **Improves Project Planning**: Clearly defined requirements help estimate timelines, costs, and resources more accurately.
3. **Reduces Rework and Costs**: Mistakes caught early in the requirement phase are cheaper to fix than those discovered during development or after deployment.
4. **Ensures Quality**: Well-defined requirements lead to a product that meets the users‚Äô needs and expectations.
5. **Supports Testing**: Test cases and acceptance criteria are based on well-written requirements.

### üåÄ Role in the SDLC:

In the SDLC, requirement analysis comes right after the project initiation phase and lays the foundation for:

- System design
- Architecture planning
- Implementation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment planning


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis phase involves several essential activities that ensure a complete and accurate understanding of what the software system should do. Below are the five key activities typically performed during this phase:

- **üìù Requirement Gathering**  
  - This involves collecting information from stakeholders such as clients, users, business managers, and technical teams.
  - The goal is to understand the needs, expectations, and constraints for the software product.
  - Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, observation, and reviewing existing systems.

- **üéØ Requirement Elicitation**  
  - Elicitation goes beyond gathering to uncover the actual needs behind what stakeholders say they want.
  - It focuses on discovering hidden or conflicting requirements through brainstorming, workshops, prototyping, and use case analysis.

- **üìÑ Requirement Documentation**  
  - The gathered and elicited requirements are documented clearly, often in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
  - Documentation should include functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, assumptions, and acceptance criteria.

- **üìä Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  - This step involves evaluating the requirements for completeness, consistency, feasibility, and clarity.
  - Modeling techniques like data flow diagrams, use case diagrams, and wireframes may be used to represent the system visually and logically.

- **‚úÖ Requirement Validation**  
  - The documented requirements are reviewed and validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs.
  - This step helps identify any errors, ambiguities, or missing requirements before the development begins.

Performing these activities thoroughly helps create a solid foundation for system design and development, reducing the chances of project failure and increasing the likelihood of delivering a successful product.

Without proper requirement analysis, projects risk **failure, scope creep, misalignment**, and **user dissatisfaction**.

In the context of this repository, understanding requirement analysis helps break down complex systems like hotel booking platforms into smaller, manageable services, ensuring a clear roadmap before development starts.


## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are typically categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential to building a system that works as expected and delivers a smooth user experience.

### üîß Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define **what the system should do** ‚Äî the specific features, behaviors, and operations it must support.

For the hotel booking management project, some functional requirements include:

- **Hotel Listing Management**  
  - Hotel managers must be able to add, update, or delete hotel information such as room types, prices, and availability.

- **Search Functionality**  
  - Customers must be able to search for hotels using filters like location, price range, amenities, and availability dates.

- **Hotel Booking**  
  - Users should be able to book a selected hotel, specifying the check-in and check-out dates.

- **Payment Integration**  
  - The system should integrate with third-party payment gateways to process transactions securely.

- **View Bookings**  
  - Both hotel managers and customers should be able to view current and past booking history.

- **Notification System**  
  - The system should notify customers about successful bookings and managers about new reservations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define **how the system should behave**. They are not about features but about qualities like performance, security, and usability.

For the hotel booking system, examples of non-functional requirements include:

- **Performance**  
  - The system should be able to handle thousands of user requests per second during peak booking seasons.

- **Scalability**  
  - The application must scale horizontally to support growing user traffic and hotel data.

- **Availability**  
  - The system should have a 99.9% uptime guarantee to ensure uninterrupted access for users worldwide.

- **Security**  
  - Sensitive data such as payment information and user credentials must be encrypted and comply with security standards (e.g., SSL/TLS, PCI-DSS).

- **Response Time**  
  - Search and booking results should load within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth user experience.

- **Maintainability**  
  - The system architecture should be modular and follow microservice principles to simplify updates and debugging.

Both types of requirements work together to guide the design and development of a robust and user-friendly hotel booking application.
