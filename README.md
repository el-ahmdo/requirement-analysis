# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository contains research and documentation focused on the **requirement analysis phase** of software development. It explores how large-scale systems, like hotel booking applications (e.g., Airbnb, Booking.com, and OYO), are architected to deliver smooth user experiences. The purpose is to understand how various services—like hotel listing, searching, booking, and payments—are handled efficiently using modern software practices such as microservices, messaging queues, caching, and distributed databases.

This repository is part of the ALX software engineering program and aims to provide clear, simplified explanations of complex system designs.
